CA2: a Drupal theme for ChicagoAncestors.org
===

This theme is built on the [Drupal Bootstrap theme](https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap). We are using the [Yeti theme](http://bootswatch.com/yeti/) from Bootswatch and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/). It utilizes [MaxCDN](https://www.maxcdn.com/) to load the Bootstrap CSS and JS files. Some tables in this theme utilize a forked version of [jQuery Tablesorter](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter).
